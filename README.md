# morpheus interfaces
GUIs developed using Tkinter to utilize [Morpheus](https://morpheus-project.github.io/morpheus/) model for morphological galaxy classification, in order to introduce AI with astronomy to high school students.

## Project Goals
We voluntarily developed GUIs for an event that the [Syrian Astronomical Association](https://www.facebook.com/SAA.YIP) will establish, the event aims to introduce AI in astronomy to high school students.

the participants will learn about the galaxies and their shapes, in addition to an introduction to AI in general.

As a part of the SAA technical team, we're looking forward to encouraging the youth who are coming to academic study to dig into the AI world, Because we believe in what Andrew Ng said "AI is the new electricity"

## about the project
We used [Tikinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) library for Python, in order to develop the GUIs which will help the users to use a sample provided by Morpheus model team, with the ability to upload their galaxy photos to be classified, so they can see how galaxies are classified based on their shapes.

you can use the samples we provided in the [samples](https://github.com/DanialAlyousef/morpheus_interfaces/tree/5ff1b13c7e20ab39d88282e48872f413f7a66baf/samples) folder.
Note: the samples folder will be updated with new samples in the future.

### User guide
you can read the user guide file in English and Arabic

## Morpheus model
A model for generating pixel-level morphological classifications of astronomical sources.
Morpheus leverages advances in deep learning to perform source detection, source segmentation, and morphological classification pixel-by-pixel via a semantic segmentation algorithm adopted from the field of computer vision.

you can learn more about the model from [here](https://morpheus-project.github.io/morpheus/), or you can check the model [repository](https://github.com/morpheus-project/morpheus) on github.
